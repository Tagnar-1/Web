  <h2>Hmm..</h2>
  <p>Well.. this is.. unexpected <br> Don't think you can find anything else here BUDDY. Since you're here anyway, I might as well tell you a great story.</p>
  <h2>Great Story</h2>
  <p>Flibber-flabber wibbly wobbly, the invisible fish swims through the sea of forgotten thoughts. Meanwhile, an army of silent rubber ducks plots world domination, but only on Tuesdays. The wind whispers secrets to the grass, but the grass never listens.
    <br>
    <br> Bananas are technically berries, but your socks don’t care. Existentially, the toaster wonders if it’s more than just a bread-warmer. Somewhere in the universe, a snail is late for an appointment it never scheduled.
    <br>
    <br> The moon, in its eternal boredom, decides to take up knitting, but only creates scarves for the wind. The wind, naturally, wears them as belts, because why not?
    <br>
    <br> In a nearby tree, a squirrel contemplates the meaning of life, but only after finishing its 72nd cup of coffee. Meanwhile, a cactus somewhere is having an identity crisis, wondering if it's a plant or just a very prickly pillow.
    <br>
    <br> A jellybean floats by, pondering if it’s more of a fruit or a candy, but soon gets distracted by the sound of invisible maracas. On the other side of the world, an invisible chair is being sat upon by an invisible person who can’t figure out why no one notices their impeccable posture.
    <br>
    <br> A giraffe in a tuxedo stands at the edge of a cliff, contemplating the color of laughter. And somewhere in the midst of this, an old shoe decides it’s ready to retire, but not before running one final marathon.
    <br>
    <br> And thus, the great cycle of nonsense continues, uninterrupted, unnecessary, and utterly delightful.</p>
